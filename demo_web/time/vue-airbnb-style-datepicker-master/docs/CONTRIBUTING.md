# Contributing Guide
I really appreciate that you like using this component, and want to help. But please, before you start creating PRs, create an issue where we can discuss if the change makes sense. It's not fun to have to deny a persons PR that they have spent a lot of time on, just because the feature doesn't make sense, or that the implementation isn't good.
I'm trying to keep the functionality and UI as close as possible to the original `react-dates` component. However, due to lack of resources and keeping file size small, vue-airbnb-style-datepicker will not support all the configurations that react-dates does.

## Running the development server
Just run `npm run dev`.

## Before you push/create a PR
Make sure that all tests are running so no existing functionality have broken.
```
npm run test
```
