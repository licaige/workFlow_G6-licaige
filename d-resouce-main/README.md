## üé≤ Support

A tool built into web applications that facilitates resource (file and folder) reading, making development tasks more efficient and enjoyable.

Key Features:

- Drag-and-Drop Support: Allows users to drag and drop files and folders directly into the tool, simplifying resource import.
- Clipboard Support: Supports copying and pasting files from the clipboard.
- System File and Folder Selection: Enables users to select files or folders directly from their system.
- Multiple Data Formats: Offers data in two formats - as an array or in a tree structure, catering to different use cases.
- Read-Only files Mode: Supports read-only access to files.
- Real-Time Filtering: Provides real-time filtering of files and folders, making it easier to locate specific resources.
- Rule Validation: Offers real-time validation of file rules; if a file doesn't meet the specified criteria, the operation can be interrupted.
- Folder Size Tracking: Automatically calculates and displays the total size of all files within each level of a folder.
- Customizable UI Hooks: Exposes drag-and-drop hover and leave hooks, allowing for UI customization and enhanced user experiences.
