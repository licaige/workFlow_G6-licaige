# Collection of simple and Difficult questions

The questions here are relatively difficult. Most of them are simulation questions, or questions that are easy to see how to solve. In addition, simple questions can generally be solved by violent methods. At this time, you only need to look at the range of data and think about the complexity of your algorithm.

Of course, it does not rule out that many hard topics can also be simulated violently. Everyone can pay more attention to the data range.

The following are the classic topics I listed (the words with 91 indicate that they are from the **91 Days of Learning algorithm**activity)ï¼š
