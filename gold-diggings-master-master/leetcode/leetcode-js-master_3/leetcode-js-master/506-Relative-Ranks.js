/**

 * Difficulty:Easy
 *
 * Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 * Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
 * Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
 * For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
 * Note:
 * N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
 * All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
 *
