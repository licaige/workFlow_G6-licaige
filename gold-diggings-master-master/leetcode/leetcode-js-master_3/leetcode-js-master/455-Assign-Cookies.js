/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/
 * Difficulty:Easy
 *
 * Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
 * You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
 * And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
 * You need to output 1.
