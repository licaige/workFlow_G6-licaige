    Approach: 
    Traverse the entire array from start to end. Since the numbers are in a range [1, n] we can use this simple trick.
    At every index mark the position arr[arr[i]] as negative.
    Repeat this for every index in the array.
    At the end, which ever places are positive, add them to our answer.
    
    Time complexity: O(n)
