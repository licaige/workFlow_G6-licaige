/*
    Given int, return array: for each i, ans[i] is # of 1's
    Ex. n = 2 -> [0,1,1], 0 = 0 has 0, 1 = 1 has 1, 2 = 10 has 1

    x = 1001011101 = 605
    x'= 0100101110 = 302
    Differ by 1 bit, by removing LSB: f(x) = f(x / 2) + (x mod 2)

    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1), the output array does not count towards space
